#LJ Code 201 - Day 16 (7/5)

###What did I learn today:

Today I learned that code needs to be readable.



**LAB:**

In Lab we worked on our class project, BroNacho. After a weekend of all of us doing our own thing, and writting our own code, we had to put everything together. We quickly noticed how confusing our code had become. We spent time and struggled naming new arrays of data. We found that less is more with code, and to make things as simple as we could. It was kinda fun working with others, because there was so much collaboration, and we could not write code that "just works", but it has to be really good and make sense to anybody reviewing it.

Additionally Sam worked with us on the localStorage issue, and we talked about capturing data in different states. It was a good review, and we finally got our local storage issue worked out.
