#LJ Code 201 - Day 17 (7/6)

###What did I learn today:

Today I learned that displaying results in a chart is much better that text. Less is more.



**LAB:**

In Lab we worked on our project all day. Kaylyn and I spent time on the results page in the afternoon, making gauges of the BroNacho score. For this we needed to download a 3rd party library. Once we got the gauges loading we did more styling on the page, to reduce scrolling and make everything very readable.

I was helping the team get to MVP - there are a lot of little things that need to happen in order, but now that we are there, we can start to add styling, and even some strech goals.
