#LJ Code 201 - Day 15 (7/1)

###What did I learn today:

Today I learned that 301 is going to be a lot of work, but understanding the basics for 201 is going to help. i also learned that working with a team takes a lot of communication - i had to translate everything that was in my head about BroNachos into words, it was not easy.


**In Class:**


- MCV (with Sam) - he reviewed how we interface with servers, the terminology that goes along with that.


- Intro to iOS w. Adam - he talked about Objective C and Swift, and how starr-ups are moving toward Swit. He mentioned a few resources (see bottom), that I can look at in the meantime.

- Intro to 301 - how to write modular code. Responsive design, allows us to assign variables, makes site easy to update. SQL - database exposure, putting data in getting it out (but will not become masters). Single Page App Dev. how to take page state, to reload pieces of interface that we need. Functional Programming - array methods, for each , sort : so that we dont have to run for loops. They are hard to learn, but awesome when you understand it, becaue you make the computer do the work. AJAX - a way to grab data from a page with out a reload(very powerful tool). Writting JavaScript with modules. Take JQuery codeacademy course
