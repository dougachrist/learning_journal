#LJ Code 201 - Day 13 (6/29)

###What did I learn today:

Today I learned that you have to pass a string into local storage - its required.


**In Class:**

- Code Review: Long Code review today - We looked at my code. Sam was able to read it pretty well, except I had one HUGE function that should have been broken into smaller chunks

  	
- UX & UI with Brian - He reviewed how to use animations, and make them look good. Great talk, demos posted in codepen.

- Persistence - how data is stored on the internet. Once we learn how to store and retrieve data locally, it willl help understand how to do it globally. Also - we learn a little more about local storage and the key-value pair. We also looked how JSON will store objects.


**LAB:**

In Lab we are adding local storage and presistance to our data. This was a little changing because I had to think about the null case, using console.log for test really helped. The more I'm coding, the better I'm getting at testing.
