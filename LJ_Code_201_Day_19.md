#LJ Code 201 - Day 10 (6/24)

###What did I learn today:

Today I learned that bandwith is a serious thing.



**Presentation:**

Today we did our preso, it went well after the mishap with my site bronacho.com going down due to bandwidth, when everyone logged in.

I learned that if you talk slow an prepare yourself you can give a great presentation, and you dont have to rush through code. Presenting well is all about making a relationship with the audience.
