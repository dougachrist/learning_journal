#LJ Code 201 - Day 12 (6/28)

###What did I learn today:

Today I learned that chart.js is a pretty cool tool for charting, and I now konw how to hook up the the host cdn file.


**In Class:**

- Code Review: We went over how to generate random numbers and how that would bring up new images. Sam showed how to work in small bits, so we could test at every step of the process.

- Chart.JS was the other big topic of the day. It was cool to see Sam walk through this, because there is so much to learn about it. I also want to get in to D3.js and other libraries.
 	

**LAB:**

In Lab we continued to work on our Bus Mall survey, and this time added charts to the end. I had a difficult time, because some of the documentation was not up to the current version. Also, ordering the arrays for the highest click thru rate was not easy, my first try did not work at all, but I learned from it, and re thought my work flow using arrays and functions on arrays, and was able to get it.
