#LJ Code 201 - Day 6 (6/20)

###What did I learn today:

Today I learned that ....


**In Class:**

- Code Review:
	
	Not much today, more code review later this week. Unit testing is good and important to do it in small chucks. Prompts and Alerts are going away, to be replaced by forms.
 	
- Domain Modeling: (Nick)

	Understand the entire code needed first - then write it, don't go back and forth between coding and thinking. Object introduction - you can setup properties of objects   to better define.  	
	
- DOM: (like your html) a tree stucture to how your html is mapped, using objects. We can interact with the DOM using JS. I learned how to modify the styling of a website using the console, by selecting objects in the DOM. 


- Object Literals: (Sam) he showed how informaion can be stored in objects, and how to set them up.



**LAB:**

In Lab we had to compete a project of calculating cookie needs for a company with 5 different stores. We had to setup an object for each store. I then ran nested for loops to update each store for each hour they needed to produce cookies. I wrote my own function to sum an array so I could provide totals for each store. 

Overall it was eaiser once I mapped out my logic on paper of the data I was going need, and I thought about how I was going accomplish reporting the data. It got challenging when I had to update my code to calculate the cookies for all the stores.
