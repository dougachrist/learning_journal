#LJ Code 201 - Day 10 (6/24)

###What did I learn today:

Today I learned that group presentations take coordination.



**LAB:**

In lab we finalized our project yesterday. It was a challenge to decide which strech goals we wanted to go for, and what we would not have time for. I learned that to make the website look polished we need to spend more time styling than on functionality. I added labels to our ingredients using absolutely positioned divs.

Also we work on how we are going to present. We spent time actualy practiing how the presestion was going to go, and what features we wanted to highlight. There was so much that went into the project, I was hard to boil it down to only the main functionality. With all of us working together on the important aspects it all works out.
