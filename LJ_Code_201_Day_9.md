#LJ Code 201 - Day 9 (6/23)

###What did I learn today:

Today I learned that less CSS is more.


**In Class:**

- Code Review: Git FLow Review - we walked through the steps to creating a fork, making an branch, pushing the branch to "origin branch", making a pull request, and pulling the changes down to the local copy. We also looked further into "get remote add upstream <URL>" to create a pipeline to the other person's Repo, so you can pull from there.

- Brian CSS and UI / UK: (play around with 'photoshop' or 'sketch') Start with wireframe, one step up from a sketch, and is a lo-fi document. start with a grid and then style the componets. Use minimal code to makde things simple.
 	

**LAB:**

(index.html focus)
In Lab we are applying CSS to our site to make them look good. I had to strip down my left nav and re-write a lot of code, but now I'm working on my own framework, and everthing on my page has a place to live.
