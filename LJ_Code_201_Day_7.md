#LJ Code 201 - Day 7 (6/21)

###What did I learn today:

Today I learned how to use the construction function to create objects in Javascript, and how to write methods for those objects using "this." to call that object inside the method. We can also user the "prototype" instance to pass properties (such as methods) to other instances of that object.


**In Class:**

- Code Review: Set var names as descriptive as possible. In the code review we setup methods to calculate customer per hour, cookies needed per hour, and how to render this data to the DOM. We nested this method so we only needed to call one, to get them all to load.

- Constructor Functions: We can use a function that will allows us to create similar objects, and pass in unique characteristics. We set parameters for the unique properties. Once we have the constructor function, we can create new objects by calling the function that creates objects.

**LAB:**

In Lab we prepared a table of data using JS to write to the DOM. After doing this multiple times, I finally felt comfortable with (step 0) creating a varible for the location of the node  where the content will go, (step 1) creating the element that we want to write, (step 2) defining the contents of that element, and (step 3) appending that element to the node we declared in step 0. We also got practice creating methods and functions, and when to use this. and when to call the array.
