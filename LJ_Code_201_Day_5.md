#LJ Code 201 - Day 5

###What did I learn today:

Today I learned that branching on git works well, but you have to be careful of what branch you are on, and it takes some time to push your changes, then accept the pull request, and then pull the updates back down to your master file.


**In Class:**

Human reabilty of code. Use consistent whitespace to make it readable. Plus when you minimize code - it will save space and increase preformance.


- Code Review:

	-use of multiple classes are delimintated by "space"
	
	-indent only when it's in a new container
	
   	-h1 is rooted in SEO (so browsers look for it, only use one per page)
   	
   	-when writing CSS setup first base style, for like div, p, h1, links ... use commas to apply the same style to multiple elements

- More CSS: when to have containers and when to use the properly. A good coder wrties minimal code. We covered the importantace of CSS list.

- Box Model:  reviewd Fixed positioning vd Float positioning

- Git Braching public facing version, on master branch.

- Other work on side project to merge into master (you want those to work on the current version, but you dont want their project to be push to the live site). for this use a branch.


We looked at functions, and saw how important it is to test them in the console.


**LAB:**

In Lab we did a project to sum and multiply number and numbers in an array. The logic got a little complicated, but wasn't too bad once we got the logic down.
