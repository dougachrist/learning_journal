#LJ Code 201 - Day 20 (7/9)

###What did I learn today:

Today I learned that JQuery is just a library to make javascript easier, and is nothing to be afraid of.


**Weekend:**

So it's the weekend, and I'm going through the JQuery classes on Code Academy. Knowing all the logic that is behind JQuery makes it very easy to pick up. I feel like im just learning shortcuts.
