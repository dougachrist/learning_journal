#LJ Code 201 - Day 4

###What did I learn today:

Today I learned that functions are great, and make it easy to commet out a chunck of code. Also, we need to define varibles outside of functions, if we want to use the globally.

**In Class:**

-Code review
we dont always need an else stmt
think about how to make code easier to read and run
This is the long way we will learn more short cuts later

-CSS Box model + layout

I learned using inline the length is determined by their length of the content. Box elements extend accross the screen.

padding controlls the content inside the box. Margin controls how the box interacts with other boxes.

Postioning:
Normal - static (as default)

Relative - simple, just normal w/ an offset.

Absolute - taken out of normal flow. They do not impact other elements. One reason to use - is as an overlay. Needs to attach to a relative item.

- JS functions


**LAB:**

In Lab we pair programmed for the first time. It was a good opportunity to share our coding styles and thought processes. All we had to do was wrap funtions around code, but we also code reviewed each others code to fix bugs and format.
