#LJ Code 201 - Day 10 (6/24)

###What did I learn today:

Today I learned that overflow auto is your friend. Also JS code can be much cleaner and easier to read with global functions.


**In Class:**

- Code Review: Get DRY. Review of how to package our files "pages" / "css" / "media" / "img" / "js" - it will make it eaiser to find things if they are in the same folder. * apply a CSS Reset file - and it needs to be the first CSS stylepage that runs! 

	Use global functions to DRY the out creating elements process. Makes it easier to see what your code is actually doing.

 	
- More CSS with Brian: UI is making things look cool, UX makes thing user friendly. If you can do both, desgin and develop - and you are in the position to make a lot of money. He continued with more codepen demos and showed how to deal with overflow


**LAB:**

In Lab we worked on a team of 3 to create a webpage based on a mockup that was provided. It took some collaboration at the beginning to setup everything and detail out our responsibilties. It was a good way to get used to working with git and git hub as well.
