#LJ Code 201 - Day 11 (6/27)

###What did I learn today:

Today I learned that Event bubble up - so we can but listeners on the node about, what we are looking for, and then get where the even happened but looking at the id of the event.


**In Class:**

- Code Review: Today we are looking at my code for the cookie project. We also looked at the assingment of the cat page. It was pretty straight forward HTML and CSS, one tip was done forget about using styling on borders to make this appear. It's easy to set borders than setting up a whole bunch of divs. 

- Review of Hoisting
 	
- Lab - review event listeners in codepen, this was a very good example.


**LAB:**

In Lab we started the project of building a user survey. Adding the event handler was not difficult. the poject just took some planning from the beginning. Once I got going the code was not too bad, because I knew what I needed. They styling took a little while, and updating the interactions always take a while too, but I think it is looking good so far.
