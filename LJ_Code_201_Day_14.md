###What did I learn today:

Today I learned that ....


**In Class:**

- Code Review: We looked at David's code, where he customized the chart.js and used a do-while loop. We also saw Erica's code where she tracked users input even if they were to leave the site, and came back. She also has charts for the session input and the overall input.

- Advanced JS (Sam): ES2015 - is the latest version of JS (ECMA Script). Node.JS - server side javascript. which means you dont need to learn another language. Also used for IOT (internet of things) to make everything connect to the internet.
 	
- CSS animations (Brian): we looked at a demo, and I learned how to use the "transistion" CSS feature to apply the style as an element moves.


**LAB:**

In Lab we worked with our project team to build out a few pages. It was a good way to see how much we can do in 2 hrs. It is important to do things correctly and in small functions - a little preparation can go really far. Then we made a mess in git and had to fix it as a team. I learned it always best to be working on a branch, and different files if possible.
