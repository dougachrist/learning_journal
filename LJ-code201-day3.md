#LJ Code 201 - Day 3

###What did I learn today:

Today we learned how to sync up a directory to git & github. I had an issue with merging histories, but I used a command to override that error.

**In Class:**

JS Flow

- we looked at naming varibles and creating arrays.

- we looked at loops and how to update the counter

**LAB:**

We practiced more loops in JS, and we even did nested loops, which was a litle challenging to think about, although I found sketching the process on paper helped. Also, if the code did not work, it helped to walk through each logic steps to see where I may have made a mistake.

At home I added a validation step to a loop, and for these steps, I did not increase the counter, since the user would need to keep entering data until it was acceptible. This made it tricky to run the loop the correct amount of times. My solution was to set extra limitations on the nested if statments to look at the counter.
