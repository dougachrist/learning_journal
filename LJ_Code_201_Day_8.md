#LJ Code 201 - Day 8 (6/22)

###What did I learn today:

Today I learned that forms can be uses in conjuction with  event listeners and handlers to dynamically update webpages, as well as up date a database (but we'll need to wait to learn about databased).


**In Class:**

- Code Review: ipsum is a good way to load sample text, you can also pull it via an html command for testing, instead of a copy and paste job. Wrap global data in a functions.

- Events with Nick: We talked about ways to add event handlers and event listeners. He walked thru examples of addEventListener to call multiple functions, and can perform data valadation rules with the function.
 	
- HTML Forms with Brian: the form element is the wrapper for all the elements themself. Then we can add "action" attributes, like where it need to go. (You dont need to have attributes though.) 

	Use fieldset tag to group similar fields: name, address, phone #. And then we added inputs and looked at differnt types and their attributes.

- Prep for Lab / Demo with Sam: We walked through his example of how he is using events to update the DOM. It was intresting that we was storing info to an array first, and then accessing that to update the DOM. He also cleared out what he wrote, so he could make update the full array with the new data.



**LAB:**

In Lab we used addEventListener to capture data in the form and append it to our sales data table. I learned that this creates an object, and that we need to access properties of that object, which can be strings, if we want to use them.
